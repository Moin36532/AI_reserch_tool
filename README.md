📄 AI Research Paper & Website Q&A Bot (LLM-Powered)

This project allows users to ask questions about any online article, research paper, or website, and the AI model (LLM) provides intelligent, context-based answers.
Simply enter the URL of the webpage or research paper and your question, and the bot will analyze the content to give accurate responses.

🚀 Project Overview

This project showcases how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to read and understand web content or academic research papers.
It scrapes the text from a webpage, processes it, and uses an AI model to answer user queries based on that content.

It’s a great example of how AI can be applied in education, research, and knowledge extraction — saving time and making dense information easy to explore.

🧠 Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Streamlit – for interactive UI

LangChain / OpenAI API – for LLM integration

BeautifulSoup4 – for scraping website content

Pandas & NumPy – for text handling and preprocessing

Scikit-learn (optional) – for additional text processing or embeddings

⚙️ How It Works

The user provides the URL of a website or research paper and a query.

The app fetches and cleans the text content from the webpage.

The LLM reads the extracted text and understands the context.

The model then answers the query based on the content of the page.
